# Bounce Climber Project Description

A simple game with player playing as a ball and you interact with platforms in different ways. Say climbing higher or purposefully breaking them.

## How I came to this project

This is my biggest project I have ever tackled! It started with me thinking of creating a very simple game, with very pleasing gameplay. This meant that I will try to polish the game so much that even simplest games will feel very nice to play. I am trying to achieve this by adding small details that will add up to the total game experience.

## About me

I haven't really touched Unity or Blender before this many years ago. I do have installed and opened both programs before, tried and noticing that it wasn't interesting to me.

Things have changed since then! Now I am going every day excited about what to do next, wanting to create new objects to use, new mechanics to create, new code and classes to add to simplify my content creation. I constantly keep brainstorming great ideas and now I am starting to add them into the README file.

I never knew documentation could be this much fun, this feels like the same as programming to me in c#, learning and using Markdown language.

## My goals with the project

My goal with the project is to learn game developement with unity. As I started creating the game I realized that creating objects in unity might not be what I want to go for, instead learn to make objects in blender.

I picked up blender and found tutorials that really sparked my interest in it, how "easy" it is to create very realistic looking objects. So now I have been sticking to Unity and Blender.

## What I want to learn from this

I aim to be able to do the basics needed to create a game from scratch on unity using blender and image manipulation software, like GIMP. Bonus to my goal is to create my game using very good design in all of the aspects I use.

I am heavily enjoying OOP and the way I can use it in unity. I am starting to get the hang of blender slowly, using geometry nodes and shaders is a ton of fun.

As of writing this now 4th of May, I still have lot to learn, but I am looking forward to finishing this project and be proud of it!
