# Bounce Climber Project Description

My first and biggest project using Unity and Blender!

My goal with the project is to learn game developement with unity. As I started creating the game I realized that creating objects in unity might not be what I want to go for, instead learn to make objects in blender.

I picked up blender and found tutorials that really sparked my interest in it, how "easy" it is to create very realistic looking objects. So now I have been sticking to Unity and Blender.

I aim to be able to do the basics needed to create a game from scratch on unity using blender and image manipulation software, like GIMP. Bonus to my goal is to create my game using very good design in all of the aspects I use.

I am heavily enjoying OOP and the way I can use it in unity. I am starting to get the hang of blender slowly, using geometry nodes and shaders is a ton of fun.

As of writing this now 4th of May, I still have lot to learn, but I am looking forward to finishing this project and be proud of it!
